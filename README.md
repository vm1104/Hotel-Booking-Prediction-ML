Predicting the cancellation of hotel booking


•	Performed Data cleaning which involved filling null values, and created a filter to 
  remove invalid data
  
  
•	Performed Spatial Analysis on data and solved the following problem statements


- Visualized from where guests are coming using a choropleth map
- How much do guests pay for a room per night using boxplot
- How does the price per night vary over the year using a line graph
- Which are the busiest month or in which months Guests are high using a line graph
- How long do people stay at the hotels using a line graph


•	Selected important Features using Co-relation


•	Performed Feature Encoding using Mean encoding technique


•	Handled Outliers by taking the log of the features


•	Performed Feature Selection using Lasso algorithm and SelectFromModel from sk.learn


•	Splitting dataset & Applying Logistic Regression to train our model


•	Cross validating and achieving a mean accuracy score of ~70%


•	Applying other algorithms such as Naïve Bayes, Random Forrest, Decision tree, KNN, and xgboost on data


•	Achieved the highest accuracy of 96.6 with xgboost and 95% with the Random Forrest algorithm
